    Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15:
Consumerism is perhaps one of the most impactful lifestyle choices on the environment. First off, buying new products uses up the finite resources on and within the Earth. Additionally, energy and land must be dedicated for the production of consumer goods. Various stages of the supply chain produce carbon emissions and waste, such as transportation and packaging for example. If consumers tend to discard and purchase products frequently because of poor habits or the product is disposable in nature, then waste in landfills can increase significantly. The more land and resources taken away for production, the greater the strain on biodiversity and the ecosystem. Sustainable consumer habits are essential to reduce waste, greenhouse gas emissions, overuse of natural resources, and the destruction of ecosystems.
