    Goal 12, Goal 13:
A large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions comes from food production, especially meat and dairy that are associated with much higher carbon and methane emissions, alongside a higher water and energy consumption rate than plant-based food. Red meat in particular is much less efficient to produce than chicken. Consequently, the greenhouse gases from livestock contribute to global warming.
