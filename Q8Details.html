    Goal 13, Goal 15: 
Using plastic single use water bottles are detrimental to the environment in both the production process and the disposal process. In the production process, fossil fuels, a nonrenewable form of energy, is used to produce plastic. In the disposal process, these plastic bottles often take thousands of years to decompose and leave microplastics that can enter food chains. This is especially present in the ocean and has proven to be deadly to the aquatic ecosystem. Using reusable water bottles eliminates the issue of production and disposal of plastic.
