    Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns:
    Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources that are derived from crude oil within the Earth. Driving more directly leads to an increased consumption in crude oil products, 
    requiring more to be extracted from the Earth. Resultantly, the limited supply of this resource decreases. In addition, methods of extraction are usually damaging to local 
    ecosystems. For example, the oil tar sands in Alberta require massive local excavation, disrupting native biodiversity.

    Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts:
    Currently, greenhouse gas emissions across the world are causing the global temperature to steadily increase. This has had a profound negative impact on climate, agriculture,
    biodiversity, sea levels, and polar ice. If the increase in temperature this century exceeds 2 degrees celsius, there will be catastrophic consequences for the Earth. The 2015 
    Paris Agreement aims to prevent this by having each participating country quickly and thoroughly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, which traps heat within the Earthâ€™s 
    atmosphere, heating the planet. One such emission is carbon dioxide. Automobile emissions are responsible for roughly 16% of global carbon emissions as of 2010. As a result of 
    When vehicle engines burn gas or diesel for fuel, carbon dioxide gas is produced. Driving less, especially in short, walkable distances, is one of the best ways to reduce carbon 
    dioxide emissions and work towards preventing global warming and climate change.
