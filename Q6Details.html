    Goal 12, Goal 13: Buying local produced food can generally result in a lower carbon footprint. Importing, whether via air, sea or road, all release massive amounts of greenhouse gases. It all depends on how itâ€™s produced and packaged, but it is more likely to have a lower environmental footprint. Food grown in local farms is very sustainable and it can be vital for developing countries.
